# Homepage

[![Built with Material for MkDocs](https://img.shields.io/badge/Material_for_MkDocs-526CFE?style=for-the-badge&logo=MaterialForMkDocs&logoColor=white)](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)

** [LINK](https://ffw-baudenbach.github.io/Homepage/) **

The Homepage is generated automatically generated on every change from the [docs](/docs) folder.

## How it works

This approach uses [MkDocs](https://mkdocs.org) to generate static html files out of markdown files.  
We use the template [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) for visualization.

The generated Website is hosted as *GitHub Page* directly with this project.  

Changes to documentation on the main branch in the [/docs](/docs) folder will generate and deploy the documentation automatically.  

Configuration is done inside [mkdocs.yml](mkdocs.yml) file.  
All template related configurations are done inside the [template.yml](template.yml) file.
